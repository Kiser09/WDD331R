        <p class="example__description">For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect amortization program and you want to install it on the workgroup server for other systems to remotely mount and use. Because this is a third-party or custom application, the logical place for it is in <span class="example__filepath | smaller__text">/usr/local/appname</span>, possibly with a link to the program binary in the <span class="example__filepath  | smaller__text">/usr/local/bin</span> directory (because that's in the path).</p>

        <p>Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS background, a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced can be of help here:</p>
        <ul class="tips__list">
            <li class="tips__list--item | tip--one"><span class="tips__bold | tips__bold--one">Hidden files aren't really hidden —</span> They just begin with a <span class="smaller__text">.,</span> such as the <span class="smaller__text">.bashrc</span> and <span class="smaller__text">.bash_profile</span> files. These are not viewable by normal users with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by commands such as <span class="smaller__text">rm -f *.*.</span></li>
            <li class="tips__list--item | tip--two"><span class="tips__bold | tips__bold--two">Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters —</span> The filenames <span class="smaller__text">this.is.a.long.file</span> and <span class="smaller__text">thisisalongfile</span> are perfectly reasonable and possible.</li>
            <li class="tips__list--item | tip--three"><span class="tips__bold | tips__bold--three">Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type —</span> Use an <span class="smaller__text">_</span> or a <span class="smaller__text">-</span> instead of spaces because it's neater and easier than prefixing all spaces with a <span class="smaller__text">\</span>. (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a space prefixes with a backslash.)</li>
